    <h1>My favorite city</h1>

    <p>My favorite city is Salt Lake. Salt lake city is the Capital of the US State of Utah.</p>
    <p>As member of the church of Jesus Christ of latter-days saints, for me, Salt lake city</p>
    <p>is the Holy land. My prayer is, one day, to have the opportunity to visiting this city.</p>
