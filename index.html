        <p>Angola, officially the Republic of Angola, is a country on the western coast of southern Africa,
            whose territory has a total area of 1.246.700 km², with an estimated population of 32.87 million people.
            The capital and largest city is Luanda, the economic and political center of the country.
            The country has vast natural resources, such as large mineral and oil reserves, and since the end of the
            civil war, its economy has shown growth rates that are among th highest in Africa. However, Angolan
            living
            standards remain low, and about 40% of the population lives on less that 3 dollars a day.
